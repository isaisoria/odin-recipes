        <h3>Cooking Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large pot over medium heat; 
                add ground beef, onion, carrots, and celery. Cook and stir 
                until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in basil and parsley. Add potatoes and broth and bring 
                to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until potatoes are

            <li>Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over 
                medium heat. Add flour and whisk until smooth, about 1 minute. 
                Gradually whisk in milk; simmer and stir until sauce is thick 
                and smooth.</li>
            <li>Stir sauce into soup, stirring constantly. Bring to a boil; 
                reduce heat to low and stir in cheese until melted. Add sour 
                cream; stir until just heated through.</li>
